The Gutenberg HTML files
=========================
1.html: [The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43)


2.html: [A Study in Scarlet by Arthur Conan Doyle](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/244/244-h/244-h.htm)


3.html: [Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84)


Changes made to the Gutenberg HTML
==================================

For all:
* Removed origin CSS and replaced with stylesheet
* Restructured the table of contents to be consistent between the three files.
* Ran HTML through a beautifier to make it easier to read
* Added `div` tags around the chapters, and removed any extra spaces between chapters.

For 1.html
* Changed the `h2` tag to `h3` for chapter titles to match the other two books.
* Added a caption to the cover image.

For 2.html
* Moved the ids for the chapters to the header itself, rather than an empty paragraph above the chapter


Fonts Used
===========
Hosted fonts were used because Firefox does not support loading fonts from files directly without changing browser settings (worked fine with Chromium though!).

* For Drop caps in the books: [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine)
* Font in ugly.html:  [Architects Daughter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Architects+Daughter)

Images
=================
* Guternberg books and good.html background: [Toptal Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/)
* Github and LinkedIn Icons: [IonIcons](https://ionicons.com/)

External sources
================
* [CSS Speech bubble](https://codingislove.com/css-speech-bubbles/)
* [Rainbow text](https://rainbowcoding.com/2011/12/02/how-to-create-rainbow-text-in-html-css-javascript/)
