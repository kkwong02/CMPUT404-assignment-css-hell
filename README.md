Changes made to the Gutenberg HTML
==================================

For all:
* Removed origin CSS and replaced with stylesheet
* Restructured the table of contents to be consistent between the three files.
* Ran HTML through a beautifier to make it easier to read
* Added `div` tags around the chapters, and removed any extra spaces between chapters.

For 1.html
* Changed the `h2` tag to `h3` for chapter titles to match the other two books.

For 2.html
* Moved the ids for the chapters to the header itself, rather than an empty paragraph above the chapter
