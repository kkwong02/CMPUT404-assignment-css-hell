## Changes made to the Gutenberg HTML

For all:
 [*] Removed origin CSS and replaced with stylesheet
 [*] Restructured the table of contents to be consistent between the three files.
 [*] Ran HTML through a beautifier to make it easier to read
 [*] Added `div` tags around the chapters, and removed any extra spaces between chapters.

For 1.html
 [*] Changed the `h2` tag to `h3` for chapter titles to match the other two books.

For 2.html
 [*] Moved the ids for the chapters to the header itself, rather than an empty paragraph above the chapter
